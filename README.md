# Project_1_Repository
This is going to be the official repository for Project 1.
Our project will be attempting to predict the 2019 MLB Cy Young, MVP, and World Series winners.
We will be using datasets of all the players from the past 3 years to make statistical player projections.
We hope to answer the following questions.
1. Project who will be the MVP of the 2018 - 2019 season? 2.What are the statistics the incoming prospect need to become an MVP next year?
3. Who has the best odds for winning the championship? **new questions** 
1. Based off performance, is the player's salary appropriate?
2. Based off performance, what team has utilized their money the best?
3. Did last year's championship team overspend?
