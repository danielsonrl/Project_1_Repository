# Project_1_Repository
This is going to be the official repository for Project 1.
Our project will showcase the historical trends of airline delays and their causes from 2010 to early 2019. Arrival and departure flight datasets will be pulled for the following airports: 

JFK - John F. Kennedy International Airport (New York City,New York)
LAX - Los Angeles International Airport (Los Angeles, California)
ORD - Chicago O'Hare International Airport (Chicago, Illinois)
ATL - Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (Atlanta, Georgia)

The team will answer the following questions:
1) What is the major cause of flight delays?
2) Over the last decade, have airline issues improved?
3) Which airline carrier has the most delays?
4) Which airport has the most delays?
5) What month of the year has the most delays?
